#geolocate
Geolocation a list of times given a list of location-time coordinates. A piece of software to help me gps tag photos from a trip.

## Example: Appalachian Trail
Started the hike at [Springer Mount Georgia](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/358771759) on April 1, 2015.

*From openstreetmap I find Springer Mt. is located at 34.6273 degrees North and 84.1935 degrees West.
*From the timestamp in the metadata of the first picture taken I find the hike started on April 1, 2015 at 8:04 AM
