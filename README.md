#geolocate
Geolocation a list of times given a list of location-time coordinates. A piece of software to help me gps tag photos from a trip.

## Example: Appalachian Trail
Started the hike at [Springer Mount Georgia](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/358771759) on April 1, 2015.

* From [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=3/27.45/-21.62) we find Springer Mt. is located at 34.6273 degrees North of the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator) and 84.1935 degrees West of [prime meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian).
* From the timestamp in the metadata of the first picture taken we find the hike started on April 1, 2015 at 8:04 AM Eastern Daylight Time.

The hike ended at [Mt. Katahdin Maine](http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/358226210)
* Again using [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=3/27.45/-21.62) we find Mt. Katahdin is located at 45.9031 degrees North of the equator and 68.9190 degrees West of the prime meridian.
* From the timestamp of last hiking photo we find the hike end on October 12, 2015 at 4:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time.

We summerize this data in a table as follows using the International Organization for Standardization specifications for formats of Latitude-Longitude coordinate, see [ISO6709](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/geo/Wiki/LatitudeLongitudeAltitude.html), and date-time formats see [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-dateti)
